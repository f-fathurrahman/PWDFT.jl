# GTH pseudopotentials

The parameters are taken from CP2K's `GTH_POTENTIALS` file.
The coupling matrix elements (h11,...,h33) are given explicitly.

# PSLIB
PSLIB pseudopotentials are now supported, they are quite huge (LDA and PBE
sets take more than 1 GB.
Please generate the pseudopotentials by yourself by following the
instructions mentioned in the PSLIB website.
